# Project Five

Project Five is a volunteer management app built as part of the software engineering capstone course at Minneapolis Community and Technical College.

## Goals
My goals for the project were to continue exploring Java and web-application frameworks using the Play Framework.

## Features
The app is designed to allow volunteer coordinators and volunteers for non-profit organization to coordinate volunteer work assignments and schedules.
- Volunteers will be able to see their assigned jobs and assignments
- Volunteer coordinators will be able to add new jobs and assignments, schedule volunteers, and post messages to the volunteers
- Potential Volunteers will be able to register their interests and availability using the site
